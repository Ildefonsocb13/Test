# Test
## Problem 1
Given a time in 12-hour AM/PM format, convert it to military (24-hour) time.
Note: - 12:00:00AM on a 12-hour clock is 00:00:00 on a 24-hour clock. 
12:00:00PM on a 12-hour clock is 12:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.
#### Example Input
A single string that represents a time in 12-hour clock format (i.e.: hh:mm:ss:AM or hh:mm:ss:PM).

'12:01:00:AM'
#### Example Output
'00:01:00'
#### Extra
Create a specific function for the conversion

## Problem 2
Given an array of integers, find the sum of its elements, max and min values.

For example, if the array ar=[1,2,3], 1+2+3=6 so return 6 3 1.

#### Example Input
[10,2,3,4,8,2]
#### Example Output
29 10 2
#### Extra
Use arrow functions

## Problem 3
Staircase detail
This is a staircase of size n=4:

       .
      ..
     ...
    ....
Its base and height are both equal to n. It is drawn using . symbols and spaces. The last line is not preceded by any spaces.
Write a program that prints a staircase of size n.
#### Example Input
6
#### Example Output
         .
        ..
       ...
      ....
     .....
    ......
#### Extra
Print the staircase upside down

## Extra Problem
Using classes create a rectangle object, which will return the area once it is instantiated
#### Example Input
new rectangle(2,3)
#### Example Output
6
